#  Marie Curie Helper Services
 ## Overview
This project is a single-page website developed as part of the Developer Interview Task for the Marie Curie Caring Services department. The goal of the project is to better promote the Helper service on the charity's website, providing users with a list of available Helper Services, contact information, and dynamic status updates.


## Main Points (Implemented)

1. List of Marie Curie Helper Services
The website displays a comprehensive list of all available Marie Curie Helper Services. Each Helper Service is represented as a list item on the page, providing users with essential information.

2. Helpline Status (OPEN or CLOSED)
The website dynamically highlights the status of each Helper Service's helpline, indicating whether it is currently OPEN or CLOSED. The status is accompanied by relevant information such as closing time for open services and the reopening day and opening time for closed services.


## Background
The Marie Curie Helper Services aim to match trained volunteers with individuals living with a terminal illness, providing free support to them and their families. The website's Scrum team has collaborated with the Caring Services team to develop a dedicated page that lists available Helper Services, showcases contact information, and dynamically indicates service availability.
